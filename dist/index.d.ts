     * When you load the Maps JavaScript API from maps.googleapis.com it applies a

     * application (such as biasing geocoding results towards the region), you can
     * override this default behavior by adding a region parameter when loading
     * the Maps JavaScript API code.
     *
     * The region parameter accepts Unicode region subtag identifiers which
     * (generally) have a one-to-one mapping to country code Top-Level Domains
     * (ccTLDs). Most Unicode region identifiers are identical to ISO 3166-1
