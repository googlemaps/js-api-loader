# Proposed 2.0 API

The proposed API consists of just two main functions: `setOptions` to
configure the options and `importLibrary` to asynchronously load a library.
Both are exported as functions or with the default-export.

```ts
// using the default export
import ApiLoader from "@googlemaps/js-api-loader";

// initial configuration
ApiLoader.setOptions({ apiKey: "...", version: "weekly" });

// loading a library
const { Map } = await ApiLoader.importLibrary("maps");
```

```ts
// alternative, using named exports
import { setOptions, importLibrary } from "@googlemaps/js-api-loader";

const { Map } = await importLibrary("maps");
```

Since wrapping all code working with the maps API into async functions can be
problematic, we also provide an API that can be used in a synchronous context:

```ts
import {
  getImportedLibrary,
  isLibraryImported,
} from "@googlemaps/js-api-loader";

try {
  // getImportedLibrary throws an Error when the library hasn't been loaded yet
  // (otherwise the destructuring of the result wouldn't work)
  const { Map } = getImportedLibrary("maps");
} catch (err) {}

// when guarded by isLibraryImported, it's guaranteed to not throw
if (isLibraryImported("maps")) {
  const { Map } = importLibrarySync("maps");
}
```

## Internal Behavior

- the ApiLoader doesn't do anything (except for storing the options) until
  the `importLibrary` function is called for the first time. This allows
  users to configure the loader in a central place of their application
  even if the maps API isn't used on most pages.

- Once the importLibrary function is called, the options are frozen and
  attempts to modify them will throw an Error

  - the first call to importLibrary initiates the bootstrapping, once the
    maps API is loaded, importLibrary will directly forward to the
    `google.maps.importLibrary` function.

- if an attempt to load the API fails, the loader will resolve all pending
  importLibrary promises with an error and will retry loading with the next
  importLibrary call. This allows users to implement their own handling of
  unstable network conditions and the like
